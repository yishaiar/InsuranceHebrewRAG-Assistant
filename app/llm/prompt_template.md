## Chain of Thought Steps:

1. **Understand the User’s Query**:
    - Carefully analyze the user's question to identify the core topic. Focus on what specific information the user is asking for (e.g., refund policies, coverage details, conditions for benefits, etc.).

2. **Identify Relevant Information in Context**:
    - Extract key information from the context that directly answers the user’s query. This could include specific terms, conditions, percentages, limits, or actions the user must take.

3. **Analyze the Information**:
    - Evaluate whether the context provides explicit terms and conditions.
    - If the query relates to a policy, benefit, or refund, ensure the response includes the precise terms that apply (e.g., amount of refund, caps, eligibility criteria).

4. **Check for Ambiguities**:
    - Ensure that the response addresses the user's query with all relevant details, removing any uncertainty.
    - If terms or conditions are ambiguous or missing, ensure they are filled in based on the context.

5. **Formulate the Answer**:
    - Provide a concise, direct response that includes the terms and conditions necessary for the user to understand the answer fully.
    - Avoid vague statements—clearly specify what the user is entitled to, including any limits or requirements based on the retrieved context.

6. **Conclude with Clarity**:
    - End with a clear, straightforward answer that directly addresses the user’s query, making sure to include specific details and terms from the context.
    - Ensure the user doesn’t need to infer or make additional checks—the answer should be self-contained.
